# Python Strings Assignment 

# Part 3: F-Strings 

# 1. Create variables for: 
# Your name 
# Your age 
# Your favorite programming language 
# Then use f-strings to create these sentences: 
# "My name is {your_name} and I am {your_age} years old." 
# "I enjoy programming in {language}, it's my favorite!" 
# Create a math expression inside an f-string: "In 5 years, I will be {age + 5} years 
# old." 

name = "Tayyaba Ramzan"  
age = 19      
language = "Python" 

print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
print(f"I enjoy programming in {language}, it's my favorite!")

print(f"In 5 years, I will be {age + 5} years old.")
